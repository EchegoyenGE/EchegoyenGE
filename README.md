# :zap: Welcome to my repository! :zap:

Hi! I'm **Gastón Echegoyen** and this is my repository. I'm from Argentina. You'll find some strange things. I'm almost a Mechanical Engineer, I´ve 3 courses left to graduate. Since I coursed *Programming, Algorithm and Data Structures* four years ago, I´ve been researching about software development.

I'm currently working as a **Fullstack Developer** at **Natural Tech House**. At present, we're working with *React*, *Next*, *Typescript*, *Node* and *Express*.

I'm currently learning about machine learning with Python in my free time. Also, I'm trying to learn to play some songs in my guitar. :guitar:

I'm looking to collaborate in an open source project.
